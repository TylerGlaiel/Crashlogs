//CrashLogs
//by Tyler Glaiel, 2023
//simple C++ crashlog output library based on C++23's <stacktrace> header
//call glaiel::crashlogs::begin_monitoring() at the start of your program 
//and it will save a stack trace to a crash log if the program crashes!
//a decent amount of this was copied & modified from backward.cpp (https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp)
//but with <stacktrace> it prints nice stack traces without needing to include pdbs and is also significantly simpler
